# Route

Best (shorter) route planing recursive algorithm.
Function takes Point[] checkpoints. Route is always starts from checkpoint[0]. Returns points order, which represents shortest route.

Fully working algorithm on 1-3 group of tests.
Working but not the fastest "skip using" solution. It works only on 4.1 big test.
