Best (shorter) route planning recursive algorithm.
Function takes Point[] checkpoints. Route is always starts from checkpoint[0]. Returns points order, which represents shortest route.

For 1 â€“ 3 groups of tests have been used method with recursive permutations.
For 4th group of tests have been used recursive greedy algorithm.
